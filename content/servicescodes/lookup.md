# **SERVICE STATUS LOOKUP API**

The **Service Status Lookup API** allows you to check the status of a transaction by providing a reference ID and token. This API is useful for tracking the state of a transaction to determine if it was successful, failed, or if there was an error.

### **Endpoint**

**URL:** `{{base_url}}/api/service/status/`

**METHOD:** `GET`

### **Request Parameters**

The request requires the following parameters:

- **token**: The token provided for authorization.
- **reference**: The unique reference ID of the transaction for which the status needs to be checked.

**Example Request:**
<pre><code class="json">
{
    "token": "ProvidedToken",
    "reference": "reference id against which status is to be checked"
}
</code></pre>
