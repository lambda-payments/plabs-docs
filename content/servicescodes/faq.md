## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**1)What is this token and which token should we use?**   
	It is a unique secret key that you have to pass along with your request that helps us identify the source of the request.It can be generated from the portal that is provided to you. You can generate two types of token. For testing purpose,you need to generate test token; which is prefixed with TEST and looks something like: TEST:askewr0923lkdf0 and for live purpose, generate LIVE token which looks something like : asdkweri023ka89s. 

**2\) Why am I getting  the response ‘Problem using the service’ ?**  
	It is required that you first request our support team for addition of service. Unless a service is added to your account, you won’t be able to use that service despite fulfilling all the requirements of a legitimate request.

**3\) Why am I getting ‘token\_not\_found’ ?**  
	It is because the token sent from your end is not consistent with the token you have generated in your portal. Make sure you send the same token that you have generated.

**4\) Why am I getting ‘TEST API not available for this service’ ?**  
	There are few services like Movie, flight for which, currently we don’t have a test environment set up. You can use live credential for testing these services. However, be careful while calling the payment API since it issues the tickets for real. Also, make sure you book flights/hotels with dates far ahead of the current date to prevent booking congestion in real time. 

**5\) Why is it that the status of my transaction is in ‘Processing’ state for so long ?**  
	It could be because of the long processing time taken from the service provider. If the status doesn’t change for a long time, you can try refreshing the transaction manually from the portal given to you. If however the issue still persists, you can call our support for details.
